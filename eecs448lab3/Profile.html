<p>Born a simple farm hand, McHammer first realized his talent for music when he started an orchestra of farm animals. After winning first place in the Cow Orchestra category in the iowa state fair, told his parents he was destined for better things. He packed only a shiny golden pair of parachute pants and made his way to Los Angeles where he was immediately spotted by a record company because of his shiny golden pants. The rest is history.</p>
